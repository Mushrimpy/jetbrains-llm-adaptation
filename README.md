# JetBrains LLM Adaptation

Solution will be posted by the 11th of April. Applied on the deadline :D, thank you for your understanding. 

## Overview
Fine-tune a model for a large open-source project. You can use retrieval techniques if you find them helpful, but fine-tuning is mandatory. Build a test dataset and choose a benchmarking task. Size is not important; this is just a demonstration example. For reference of the tasks, you can look at our paper on code-related long context benchmarks: Long Code Arena (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11612).
Demonstrate a learning curve and discuss it.
Provide the solution as a GitHub repository with documentation.
